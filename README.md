# PTC Heated bed fans mod for Voron 2.4 Printers
Installed on Voron 2.4 bed rails. 

Can be placed on the outside or inside (instead of a Nevermore Micro).

Outer placement will be covered by the bed for 300 and 350 size but exposed on 250 size.

## Es Ist Verboten

Installation of this mod involves wiring mains AC voltage and addition of heaters without thermistor feedback. 

Careful wiring and component selection can reduce the risk of injury or fire, 
but only similar to the existing components of a v2.4 but never zero.

This mod should not be attempted without experience and caution.
