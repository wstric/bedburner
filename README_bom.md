# BedBurner detailed BOM

* Heater block
  * Heatsink - 50mm x 50mm x 20mm
  * Machined with component pockets and tapped holes.
  * For best results use a CNC mill.
    * provided [STEP](/CAD) or [DXF](/Drawing/block)
  * Can be machined with hand tools if you have the resolve.
    * 3D printable [guides and templates](/STL/block_template) provided.
    * Drill guide uses 2.0mm bit. Step up to 2.5mm bit for M3 tap.
    * Have multiple drill bits. You will break multiple.
    * Have multiple M3 start & end taps. You will likely break one.
    * Drill/tap depth is 4.5mm
    * Use a 5/16" OD Router bushing for router templates
    * Prototype set was made with hand tools. It was painful.

* Mouting bracket
  * Cut and bend in 16ga mild steel using the [DXF](/Drawing/bracket)
  * Mirror pairs can be made using bend up and bend down.
  * Prototype set made with SendCutSend.

* Component straps
  * Cut and bend in 22ga steel using the DXF files.
  * One ptc and one tswitch strap each.
  * Prototype set made with SendCutSend.

* PTC heater
  * Aluminum shell PTC heater.
  * Nominal size 35mm x 20mm x 5mm size.
  * Quality control is loose so test draw and max temp before usage.

* Thermal switch (tswitch)
  * KSD9700 insulated bimetal temperature/thermostat switch.
  * Recommended 120C Normally Closed.
  * Quality control is loose so test trigger temp before usage.

* Optional thermal paste/grease
  * use to improve conductivity between PTC shell or thermal switch and heater block.
  * operation temperature should be higher than PTC or Thermal switch rating.

* Fan duct
  * [STLs](/STL/fan_duct) provided.
  * Typical voron print settings.
  * 2 x printed screw diam spacers are optional.

* 5015 radial (blower) fan

* 2 x short M3 heatset insert (M3 x 4.6mm x 3mm)
  * not common but [CNC Kitchen](https://cnckitchenus.store/products/heat-set-insert-m3-x-3-short-version-100-pieces) makes them.

* 4 x M3, 8mm BHCS/SHCS - for the PTC and tswitch.
* 2 x M3, 4mm BHCS/SHCS - for block to bracket.
* 2 x M3, 18mm BHCS/SHCS - for fan to duct.
  * Not a common size.
  * Cut down longer screws if needed.
* 2 x M3, 6mm BHCS/SHCS - for bracket to extrusion.
* 1 x M3, 8mm BHCS/SHCS - for duct to extrusion.
* 2 x 2020 M3 t-nuts (twist-in or roll-in preferred).
